Revision history for Perl extension JS-Chicken

0.03
    - added some new types of parameters that
      can be passed and how they are handled.
      - raw callback function
        - if passed a function, it simply
          gets applied with the target as
          its only argument
      - Chicken.Param.Attributes
        - this can be passed instead
          of just a string and it will
          be used to alter the attributes
          of the target instead of just
          its innerHTML
      - Chicken.Param.EventHandlers
        - this can be passed instead
          of just a string and it will
          be used to attach event handlers
          to a target

    - Added Chicken.Param.Combinator
      - this accepts an array of the parameters
        above and applies them in order to the
        target

    - allowing the '.' selector to work
      on the current element in a collection
      rather then needing to have extra layers
      - added tests for this
    - changed testing infrastructure to Qunit
      from the older Test.Builder version
